# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Purpose and Goals

This project endeavors to be a safe space for contributors regardless of religion, social
status, religion, race, or any other classification scheme, offensive or not. We will not
tolerate abusive language or direct personal attacks.

## Icing

If presented with a Smirnoff Ice, one must immediately drink it on one knee. Icers are
assumed to be acting responsibly, and in good faith. Responsibility is defined as:

> able to answer for one's conduct and obligations

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all realms, real and imagined: in real life, on the
internet, in virtual reality as well as on spiritual and spectral planes heretofore
unknown to mere mortals.

## Capers, Hijinks and Jobs

Project contributors are expected to act in good faith when engaging in acts of theft,
espionage, or burglary that result in a windfall of gems, diamond, ancient artifacts of
a great power and other treasures. If the spoils were a product of this software, they
are expected to share the bounty with other contributors. In the case of artifacts,
any known curses/traps must be disclosed.

## Enforcement and Application

If any memeber of this community engages in insulting or offensive behavior as defined
in this document, please let the administrators of this project know immediately. This
project reserves the right to ban repeat offenders and engagers of egregious conduct.
